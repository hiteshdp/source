      <p>Website Terms of Service</p>
      <p>Last Revised: December 23, 2021</p>
      <p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are entered into between you (“you,” or “User”) and Wellkasa Inc. (“Company,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”).  These Terms govern your access to, and use of Company services offered on the website located at <a href="https://wellkasa.app/" target="_blank">https://wellkasa.app/</a> (the “Website”).</p>
      <p><strong class="border-bottom border-dark">These Terms include an arbitration clause.  Please read the Terms carefully before you start to use the Website.</strong></p>
      <p>By accessing, browsing, submitting information to and/or using the Website, you agree and acknowledge on your own behalf (referred to throughout the Terms as “you”) that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms and to comply with all applicable laws including, without limitation, all federal, state and local tax and tariff laws, regulations, and/or directives. <strong>If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Website.</strong></p>

      <h4><strong>1. <span class="border-bottom border-dark">Purpose of the Website</span>. </strong><h4>
      <p>The Website is provided for informational purposes and the purposes of enabling communication between you and the Company. The Website also provides information about Natural Medicines, in which Wellkasa has partnered with Therapeutic Research Center (“TRC”) to provide such information. The editorial principles and process followed by TRC can be found on:</p>

      <p><em class="border-bottom border-dark">Not for Medical Advice</em>. Wellkasa and TRC are not healthcare providers, payers or clearinghouses.

      <h4><strong>8. <span class="border-bottom border-dark">Website Subscriptions<span>.</strong><h4>
        <p>You may have the option to purchase a subscription service through the Website. If you choose to purchase a subscription, the following terms shall apply:</p>
        <p><em>Registration & Authorized Users</em>. In order to establish an active subscription, you must have a Website account (“Wellkasa Account”).  Your subscription will be automatically validated each time you sign in to the Website.  It is a condition of use of the Website and subscription that all information provided by you will be correct, current, and complete and will not violate any law.  If the Company believes the details that you provided are not correct, current, or complete, or that you have otherwise violated these Terms, or any law, the Company has the right at its sole discretion to suspend, terminate, or refuse your access to the Website, Wellkasa Account, and/or our services.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for all activity occurring under your Wellkasa Account, including the devices that are used to access the Website. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the username and password to your Wellkasa Account.  In addition, to prevent unauthorized access to your Wellkasa Account of the Website, you must maintain control over the devices used to access the Website or services and not reveal associated usernames and passwords or Payment Methods (as defined below) to anyone.  The Company shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the use or misuse of your Wellkasa Account.  You will be responsible for all activity on the Website resulting from use of your usernames and passwords.  You acknowledge and agree that you are: (a) responsible for any breach of these Terms by you or any other individual using your Wellkasa Account; and (b) jointly and severally liable with each such user for any breach of these Terms.</p>

        <p><em class="border-bottom border-dark">Fees and Payments</em>. By using the Website and services, and selecting any services that we offer for a fee on a subscription basis, you accept the cost of the services that you have elected to pay, and you authorize the Company and/or its trusted third-party partners to process your payment from the credit or debit card or other payment source that you have identified through your Wellkasa Account (“Payment Method”).  If you purchase any services that we offer for a fee, you agree to pay the Company, directly or via its designated third-party payment processor, all applicable fees as they become due plus all applicable related taxes. You may cancel your subscription from time to time as provided on the Website and in these Terms.  We may refuse to renew any subscription.</p>

        <p>Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, if you select a service subject to a recurring monthly subscription fee for use of the Website and services (the “Subscription Fee”), notwithstanding any then-applicable payment arrangement, you agree to pay the Subscription Fee and any volume-based or consumption-based charges applicable to the services that you selected. Such Subscription Fees may vary depending upon the subscription plan selected by you, such as monthly or annual plans. Your billing will be provided by the Company or its trusted third-party partners.  The Subscription Fee may be billed immediately upon subscribing to our services and on an ongoing regular monthly basis unless you cancel the subscription. Please note that billing cycles may vary.  Note that the timing of your billing may change (i.e., in the event of a problem with your Payment Method, such as an expired credit card).  You should confirm the applicable billing policies prior to establishing your subscription.  Current Subscription Fees associated with the Website and services can be found on the Website. The Company may change the Subscription Fee and adjust pricing for the services or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.  We will notify you thirty days in advance of any change in Subscription Fees by posting such changes to the Subscription Fee on the Website. You accept the new fees by continuing to use the Website and services after the fee change takes effect.  If you do not agree with the applicable price change, you have the right to reject the change by terminating your Wellkasa Account through the Website in accordance with these Terms.</p>

        <p>You may update your Payment Method with the Company at any time by accessing your Wellkasa Account.  If at any time the Company is unable to charge your Payment Method for the Subscription Fee due to insufficient funds, expired or invalid Wellkasa Account details, or otherwise, you remain responsible for the cost of such Subscription Fee. A change in your Payment Method may result in changes to your prior billing cycle.  It is your responsibility to update and maintain the Payment Method associated with your Subscription Fee.  In the event your Payment Method is unable to cover the Subscription Fee, the Company reserves the right to suspend your access to the Website and services until such time as the payment method has been updated and the Subscription Fee is duly paid.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to retry or permit its third-party partners to retry billing your Payment Method after failed attempts (e.g., if Payment Method is rejected).  We also reserve the right to pursue or permit our trusted third-party partners to pursue any amounts you fail to pay in connection with your subscription. If the Company is unable to collect your payment using one of the foregoing methods, the Company reserves the right to freeze or cancel your Wellkasa Account in its sole discretion.  You will remain liable for all such amounts and all costs incurred in connection with the collection of any unpaid amount, including, without limitation, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and litigation and/or arbitration costs.</p>

        <p>All information that you provide to register with the Company, including, without limitation, your Payment Method, is subject to the Company’s Privacy Policy.  We may use a third-party payment service to charge your Payment Method.  By submitting your information relating to your Payment Method, you grant the Company the right to store and process your information with the third-party payment service, which may change from to time.  You agree that the Company will not be responsible for any failures of the third party to adequately protect such information.  You acknowledge that we may charge (or use a third-party payment service to charge) your Payment Method for any applicable fees associated with your Wellkasa Account or other amounts owing to the Company in connection with your use or misuse of the services or Website.  Without limiting the foregoing, if any payment or transfer you make from your Wellkasa Account is returned unpaid, you authorize the Company (or a third-party payment service) to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your Payment Method to collect an amount equal to the fee charged for such return.</p>

        <p>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ANY FEES AND FOR PROVIDING THE COMPANY WITH A VALID PAYMENT METHOD FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES THROUGH ONE OF THE METHODS THAT WE LIST ON OUR WEBSITE FROM TIME TO TIME.</p>


        <p><em class="border-bottom border-dark">Cancellation</em>.  YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME. If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will become effective immediately.  If you purchased a monthly subscription, any cancellation must occur 24 hours prior to the next billing date to avoid any further charges.  If you purchased an annual subscription plan, and you cancel your subscription within the 12 month period, you will be refunded on a pro-rated basis for the remaining months left on your subscription. Any refund is at the Company’s sole discretion. </p>
