        <blockquote> "We know that the migraine journey is often a debilitating one that can create a sense of helplessness and feeling passive in the face of mounting symptoms. This is especially true if multiple treatments are not well tolerated or helpful. Migraine Might attempts to empower those with migraine and their loved-ones by reclaiming control with knowledge and insight, an expanded self-care toolbox, and resources to help incorporate these treatments to make the journey more livable. As important, the tracking and self-care tools were developed knowing that those with migraine are impacted in the most productive years of their lives. That’s why MigraineMight aims to be the quickest and simplest road to learning about and improving your migraines."
