Your continued use of our Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.</p>

   
   <p class="mb-1"><strong >1. What We Collect and How We Collect It</strong></p>
   <p >To ensure that we provide you with the best possible experience, we will store, use, and share information about you in accordance with this Policy.</p>
   <p >a. <em >Information You Provide to Us:</em> Personal Information is any information that can be used to individually identify you from a larger group, such as data including, but not limited to, your:

      <li>request information;</li>
      <li>subscribe to our emails; and</li>
      <li>sign up to join a focus group.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The information that you provide in each case will vary. In some cases, you may be able to provide Personal Information via email or free text boxes, such as contacting the Company to request further information. When providing your Personal Information, please provide only relevant information and do not provide unnecessary sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers or other sensitive personal data. We collect Personal Information only when you have agreed to our request for that information.</p>
    
   <p >b. <u ><em >Focus Groups</em></u>. Occasionally, we may offer focus groups in which we ask for participants to give us input in order to help build our Website and overall platform. If you choose to participate in a focus group, we may ask you to provide your first and last name, phone number, age, gender, mailing address, email, medical diagnosis information, and other information related to how your treatment is progressing. Focus groups are voluntary and it is your choice on whether to participate and provide any necessary or optional information. We will use your answers and input to improve our Website and overall platform.</p>
   <p class="mb-1"><strong >2. Protocols and Pharmacy Products.</strong></p>
   <p>The Website may contain information about Protocols related to specific diseases and conditions. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information at any particular time. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. Additionally, the Website may link to the Wellkasa Fullscript Pharmacy where you may create an account, provide Personal Information and purchase products from Fullscript. Such information sharing is subject to Fullscript’s privacy policy and terms of service. For more information, please review Fullscript’s privacy policy and terms of service.</p>
   <p class="mb-1"><strong >3. Research Information about Natural Medicines</strong></p>
   <p>Wellkasa has partnered with Therapeutic Research Center (TRC) to provide information about Natural Medicines. The editorial principles and process followed by TRC can be found on:</p>
   <p ><span style="word-break: break-all;"><a  href="https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/about-us/editorial-principles-and-process.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/about-us/editorial-principles-and-process.aspx</a></span></p>

   <p>Wellkasa and TRC are neither healthcare providers, payers nor clearinghouses. Wellkasa is a platform built to promote holistic patient wellness and quality of life through an integrative care ecosystem that connects standard of care with effective complementary therapies. Unless otherwise established in a business associate agreement between Wellkasa and a regulated Covered Entity (i.e., a doctor, pharmacy, or insurer), as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), Wellkasa does not collect “Protected Health Information” as defined under HIPAA.</p>
   
   <p ><u ><em >Not for Medical Advice</em></u>. The content provided on the Website, including, but not limited to, TRC content (such as articles, research and other documents related to complementary and alternative medicine, licensed by TRC to Wellkasa (collectively, “TRC Content”)), are not provided for medical, clinical or other advice. Wellkasa is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment. SUCH WEBSITE CONTENT, INCLUDING TRC CONTENT, IS BEING PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND USERS SHOULD CONSULT WITH QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS FOR ANSWERS TO GENERAL AND SPECIFIC MEDICAL AND CLINICAL QUESTIONS. 
   </p>
   <p class="mb-1"><strong>4. Wellkasa WellKabinet&#8482; and Interaction Checker</strong></p>

   <p >You may have the option to provide information about your health (including medical conditions, medicines, and other treatment) on the Website. The WellKabinet&#8482; and Interaction Checker can automatically provide you information on how natural medicines and your current medicines or treatment may interact. <strong><em >The information provided in your WellKabinet&#8482; or the Interaction Checker is not provided as medical, clinical or other advice.</strong></em> Your reliance on such information is strictly at your own risk. Never use Wellkasa, or contact Wellkasa, if you have a medical emergency. If you ever have a medical emergency, you should contact your primary physician or local authorities for assistance.</p>
   <p class="mb-1"><strong>5. Automated Information Collection</strong></p>
   <p>In addition to the information that you provide to us, we may also collect information about you during your visit to our Website. We collect this information using automated tools that are detailed below. These tools may collect information about your behaviour and your computer system, such as your internet address (IP Address), the pages you have viewed, and the actions you have taken while using the Website. Some of the tools we use to automatically collect information about you may include:</p>

   
   <p >a. <u >Cookies</u>. A “cookie”  is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device’s hard drive. Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use either (or both) of them:</p>
   <ul style="list-style: auto;">
      <li>session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close your browser, and</li>
      <li>persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.</li>
   </ul>

   <p >We use the following categories of cookies on our Website.</p>
<ul style="list-style: lower-roman">
   <li ><strong >Strictly Necessary Cookies.</strong> These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have requested, such as maintaining a record of your purchased items (e.g. a shopping cart), cannot be provided.</li>
   <li ><strong >Performance Cookies.</strong> These cookies collect anonymous information on how you use our Website to help us understand how you arrive at our Website, browse or use our Website and highlight areas where we can improve, such as navigation. The data stored by these cookies never shows personal details from which your individual identity can be established.</li>

   <li ><strong >Functionality Cookies.</strong> These cookies remember choices you make such as the country from which you visit our Website, your preferred language, and your search parameters. This information can then be used to provide you with an experience more appropriate to your selections and to make your visits to our Website more tailored to your preferences. The information in these cookies may be anonymized. These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</li>
   <li ><strong >Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies. </strong>iv.These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The cookies are usually placed by third-party advertising networks. These cookies remember the websites you visit and that information is shared with other parties, such as advertisers.</li>
   </ul>

   <p >If you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser’s settings. However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Website’s features or lose access to some functionality.</p>
   
   <p ><span style="word-break: break-all;">b. <u >Google Analytics</u>. The Website sends aggregated, non-Personal Information to Google Analytics for the purpose of providing us with the ability to conduct technical and statistical analysis on the Website’s performance.  For more information on how Google Analytics supports the Website and uses information sent from the Website, please review Google’s privacy policy available at <a  href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.</p>
   <p >c. <u >Web Beacons</u>. A Web Beacon is an electronic image. Web Beacons can track certain things from your computer and can report activity back to a web server allowing us to understand some of your behavior. If you choose to receive emails from us, we may use Web Beacons to track your reaction to our emails. We may also use them to track if you click on the links and at what time and date you do so. Some of the third-party marketers we engage with may use Web Beacons to track your interaction with online advertising banners on our Website. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your Personal Information. Please note that any image file on a webpage can act as a Web Beacon.<br>
      <br>
      
   </p>
   <p >d. <u >Embedded Web Links</u>. Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link. The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system. The redirection system allows us to understand how the link is being used by email recipients. Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold about you. This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.<br>
      <br>
      
   </p>
   <p >e. <u >Third-party Websites and Services (Advertising Partners).</u> We work with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide. The information collected can be gathered on our Website and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing. For example, we may collect data where our banner advertisements are displayed on third-party websites.</p>
   <p class="mb-1"><strong >6. Your Choices and Selecting Your Privacy Preferences</strong></p>
   <p >We want to provide you with relevant information that you have requested.</p>
   <p >If we provide subscription-based services, such as email newsletters, we will allow you to make choices about what information you provide at the point of information collection or at any time after you have received a communication from us while you are subscribed. Transactional or service-oriented messages are usually excluded from such preferences, as such messages are required to respond to your requests or to provide goods and services, and are not intended for the purposes of marketing.</p>
   <p >We will not intentionally send you email newsletters and marketing emails unless you consent to receive such marketing information. After you request to receive these emails, you may opt out of them at any time by selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. Please note that by opting out or unsubscribing you may affect other services you have requested we provide to you, in which email communication is a requirement of the service provided.</p>
   <p class="mb-1"><strong >7. Accuracy and Access to Your Personal Information</strong></p>
   <p >We strive to maintain and process your information accurately.

   <p class="mb-1"><strong >13. Third-party Websites</strong></p>
   <p >This Policy does not apply to websites or other domains that are maintained or operated by third parties or our affiliates. Our Website may link to third-party websites and services, but these links are not endorsements of these sites, and this Policy does not extend to them.

   <p >If you are a California consumer, as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<u >Act</u>”), please be advised that Wellkasa Inc. does not currently meet the regulatory thresholds of a “business” as that term is defined under the Act and therefore is not required to comply with the Act.
